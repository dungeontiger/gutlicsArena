Gutlic's Arena
===

A single player game based on the Gutlic's Arena adventure.

Gutlic is a crazy and powerful goblin rogue who sucks random adventurers in his arena and makes them fight before a live audience.

He is aided by his equally crazy assistant Beguile who is a beholder.

This is intended to be a client-server project with the server being implemented in Python with the client being either Python (command line) or JavaScript.  In either case the interface will be REST.

The game system will be the D&D 5th Edition https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd
