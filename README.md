Gutlic's Arena
===

A single player game based on the Gutlic's Arena adventure.

Gutlic is a crazy and powerful goblin rogue who sucks random adventurers in his arena and makes them fight before a live audience.

He is aided by his equally crazy assistant Beguile who is a beholder.

This is intended to be a client-server project with the server being implemented in Python with the client being either Python (command line) or JavaScript.  In either case the interface will be REST.
